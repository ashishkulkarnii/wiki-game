## The Wiki Game Solver

Inspired by The Wiki Game, this is the start of a path validator.
Currently, this is a brute-force solution using simple breadth-first search to find a path between two Wiki pages.
With future iterations, I plan to integrate the usage of natural language processing techniques such as Word2Vec, or even cosine similarity between the intermediary and target articles to create a more efficient solver.
